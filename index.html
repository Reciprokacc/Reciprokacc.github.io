      <h2 class="section-heading specialColor">SELF-PROPELLING ENTREPRENEURIAL COALITION FOR AN ETHICAL ECONOMY</h2>
      <p class="section-description">While several organizations already provide services for workers and communities to gain ownership over productive assets, we believe that a more <b>systematic approach</b> is required to create an ethical and federated counter-economy able to perpetuate itself on its own. <br/>A network of mutually-owned co-operatives federated around a common accumulation mechanism might just do the trick to instigate a <b>self-propelling co-operative system</b>.</p>
<div class="row rowBelowText">
        <div class="one-half column">
            <h4>Reclaiming the commons</h4>
          <p class="description">Traditional co-operatives tend to adopt the logic of their market environment by focusing on individual organisational gain rather than the build-up of an integrated, ethical economy. 
Reciproka functions as a structure to <b>align interests by mutualising ownership</b> of each co-operative under a common trusteeship legal structure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-half column">
            
            <h4>Reclaiming finance</h4>
          <p class="description">
To turn this federated coalition into a self-propelling co-operative system, it needs a mechanism to accumulate value for further expansion. 
Therefore, a share of each co-operative’s profits is pooled to feed a <b>common internal investment fund</b> designed to grow this ethical entrepreneurial coalition through further conversions.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">HERE IS HOW IT WORKS</h3>
      
          <p class="section-description">Reciproka is a system that facilitates the development of a self-propelling, open co-operative movement through ownership transfer support services, network building and co-operative accumulation.</p>
      
      <div class="row specialMargin specialJustify">
        <div class="one-third column">
            <h5>Ownership transfer</h5>
          <p class="description">Reciproka acquires enterprises from retiring owners on behalf of their employees to transition them into “open co-operatives”. While ownership of each co-operative is mutually held between all of Reciproka’s members, governance of the individual enterprises remains with their workers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-third column">
            <h5>Network building</h5>
          <p class="description">Technical and process support is provided to the newly-formed open co-operatives via an internal team of mentors to help them adopt sustainable business models and integrate into a co-operative value chain network.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-third column">
            <h5>Co-operative accumulation</h5>
          <p class="description">Reciproka pays its operational and financial expenses, finances new acquisitions of additional co-operatives and pays out an increasing income to its investing members by mutualising a share of each co-operative’s profits for a commonly held fund.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
          <p class="section-description">Financial and technical support facilitate individual enterprise conversions. Network building services and common ownership unite the co-operative ventures into a federated whole. The co-operative accumulation mechanism is the missing piece which makes the co-operative system integrated, competitive and financially attractive for outsiders to join.</p>

<div class="row rowBelowText">
        <div class="one-third column">
          <p class="description"><b>Owners</b> are provided with an exit strategy by being enabled to sell their enterprises to their employees while being ensured that their enterprise remains operating as a valuable institution in their local community. 
Owners can also become active members of Reciproka by investing their enterprises as productive capital into the coalition, thus receiving a growing income from Reciproka’s proceeds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-third column">
          <p class="description"><b>Employees</b> are given the management of their company and receive technical and process support from Reciproka. 
Besides sharing into their co-operative’s profits, the workers progressively become co-owners of Reciproka as a portion of their co-operative’s profits is automatically reinvested into the internal investment mechanism, and thus receive a growing income from its proceeds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-third column">
          <p class="description"><b>Citizens</b> can participate in crowd-equity campaigns to support the transition of specific businesses and/or by providing equity to the common fund. 
This way, citizens can become co-owners of Reciproka, are entitled to a share of the coalition’s proceeds and actively help growing a sustainable, community-empowering economy. </p>
